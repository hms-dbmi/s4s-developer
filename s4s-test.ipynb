    "#### Data\n",
    "Use an online database >> The [Sean Lahman's Baseball Database](http://seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics) which contains the \"complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2013, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, post-season data, and more. For more details on the latest release, please [read the documentation](http://seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2012.txt).\"\n",
